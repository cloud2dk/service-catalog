# Implementation Plan: HumanLayer Resource-Plan-Code Methodology

## Overview

Implement HumanLayer's structured development process consisting of 5 specialized commands (`/research_codebase`, `/create_plan`, `/implement_plan`, `/commit`, `/describe_pr`) and 6 supporting agents to enable systematic, well-documented software development cycles for cloud infrastructure projects.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure
- ✅ Repository: `cloud2dk/service-catalog` - multi-service cloud infrastructure project

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Individual Agent Testing**: Test each agent with simple, isolated tasks
- **Command Testing**: Verify each command handles expected inputs and produces correct outputs
- **Template Testing**: Validate all documentation templates generate proper YAML and structure

### Integration Testing
- **Agent Coordination**: Test parallel agent execution and result coordination
- **Command Chain**: Run complete research → plan → implement → commit → PR sequence
- **Cross-Repository**: Test methodology on different service directories (monitoring, reporting, access)

### Infrastructure-Specific Testing
- **YAML Analysis**: Test agents on CloudFormation/CDK templates and GitHub workflows
- **Lambda Code**: Test codebase analysis on Python lambda functions
- **Multi-Service**: Test pattern finding across different service architectures
