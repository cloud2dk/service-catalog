## Example Good Commit Message

```
Fix Service Catalog scope handling for regionally-pinned products

Updated publish.sh and release.sh to respect the `scope` field in manifest.yaml:
- Global products (scope: global) continue deploying to all active regions
- Regionally-pinned products (e.g., scope: us-east-1) now only deploy to their specified region

This fixes the reporting workflow failure where usage-exports was incorrectly trying to deploy BCM Data Exports (us-east-1 only service) to all regions.
